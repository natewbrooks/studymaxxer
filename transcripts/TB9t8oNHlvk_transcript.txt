might have noticed I haven't been live
in a while and that's because I've been
playing League of Legends and I've
climbed from Silver 4 to Silver one my
alltime peak in just two days not only
that I'm currently two games away from
gold we're not here to talk about all my
accomplishments it's a long list we're
here to talk about some
allegations yeah I have seen them a lot
of people are accusing me of unethical
gameplay maybe even outright cheat
because of this High ELO gain there must
be a reason it's happening it can't be
that Ludwig's time in has profited in
some way unimaginable let's talk about
it now for the uninitiated here's my
op.gg it's blue that [ __ ] is blue all
right and specifically this is when I it
really started two days ago over the
past 20 games I I have won 15 of them I
have lost four I guess that math isn't
math but you get the point one of them
was a AFK or whatever uh so I went I
went basically 15 and four my amumu is
playing out of this world with a 3.75
KDA but here's where we have to be a
little
honest I have had a coach specifically
Perry okay he's a former jungle uh Pro
played for DSG now turned YouTube uh
coach uh he helps various people try to
hit their their goals plat emerald
diamond whatever uh and I had a live
coaching session with Perry yesterday
where we played a a bunch of games
together basically from this loss all
the way up until this win so I don't
know what one two three four five six
seven eight eight total games together
we went six wins two losses okay eight
total games
together but for some reason because of
that
people are saying that this doesn't
count because I had live coaching most
people don't have access to it why why
why should I be allowed because I care
more okay that's why and they don't they
don't they don't like the fact they in
the facts that I won six straight
without Perry 1 two 3 4 five six zero
losses the day before playing with him
and today today we're starting off hot
two backtack W's okay just had a Mumu
game that would [ __ ] knock Perry
socks off anyway I figured because I'm
two wins away from gold literally two
W's separating me and a new
Peak I might as well record it that's
what this is okay so there's there's no
live coaching here you can see for
yourself the difference between my play
online and the play offline okay CU
there look there is a difference I'm not
going to lie about that I do play better
offline why well I don't read chat for
one that's a distraction okay two I
don't get sniped all right maybe you
think it doesn't happen I think it
happens I think I'm getting ghosted I
think people even if they don't
intentionally try to snipe me might
recognize my username in the in the que
up menu then see if I'm live and then
well it's already there you might as
well [ __ ] keep watching while I'm
here that happens okay or
sometimes they just try to [ __ ] me over
a little harder okay that happens too
maybe they even if they're not looking
they know I'm in the game they try to
invade more or you know counter me more
stuff like that
okay so you're going to see you're going
to see my offline game my very diligent
offline gameplay uh and let's start off
with our champ select now I've been
rocking only a Mumu fiddle six is
basically gone I played one game with
fiddle six today where I I mean frankly
I played pretty horribly I got kind of
carried in that game uh so shout out for
my team I had one good Al that set up my
bot Lane to basically carry me uh but
but yeah I'm sticking with amumu and my
mumu's doing good you know he's not
strong enough to carry every game but he
does a lot of damage early and a lot of
CC late and I got my amumu combos down
it's called
qer Auto q
e or easier is just q r e q auto that
also works just one one less one less e
in that
Arrangement uh all right let's take a
look we're going up against the graves
that can can be tough that can be tough
I've been watching some Graves vods
though specifically of aumu against
Graves Sawyer jungle shout out Sawyer uh
what's up Bob all right lock me in lock
me in with Mumu all right I love
Mumu uh but yeah anyway streaming it
live is just too hard bro it's just too
hard I I would love to do it I really
would I can maybe I I I'll stream some
of it like maybe you know if I'm going
for uh a climb or something like if I'm
if I'm plat and I'm about to hit it
maybe I want to do that live something
like that I'm not sure I'm not
sure ah all right let's look at take a
look at the teams take a look at these
comps so we have Victor
mid Caitlyn vers Jinx okay so people saw
Arcane recently they got back into the
game I get that
y okay their team is atro top vers himad
ding
okay Jinx Lux excuse me Lux mid Jinx
ybot and then grave jungle all right
okay okay this is interesting this is
interesting here's the thing I don't
know how to path into a himer I don't
know that guy [ __ ] confuses me he
throws down a lot of robots and what
have you I'm just going to path bot I
also feel like I have more success
pathing bot you
know ultimately top is kind of fine
being in their own world and they don't
need me to interfere with it all right
so I won't so I won't interfere taking a
look at the damage distribution please
don't turn on back seat AI I find it to
be one of the most
insane uh piece of technology ever thank
you all right this it looks like a
support Gap game for a second there uh
this seems like a
very they have an 0 jungler ad80 top ADC
and then they have AP onl and AP
so we'll see who gets big on their team
we'll see who gets
big I'm mulling over what I'm going to
build I'm probably going to go
leandre's that's a lie I'm definitely
going leandre's I don't know why I'm
[ __ ] around maybe I'll go Sunfire
after though maybe I'll go
Sunfire but we have
Victor and himad
Dinger so maybe I'll go maybe I'll go
Abyssal mask second
instead is honer even AP
I assume yeah you got the damn ring
that's tough that's tough okay I thought
it was going to be support cap support
might be a bit drunk it's all right as
long as you die in time to get back
that's
okay but I do think Sona fell asleep at
the wheel a bit certainly doesn't help
me in my matchup but I don't mind it
happens to all of us we've all been
there
uh let me adjust my camera a bit as well
I changed my
HUD okay and by I change it I mean I
literally can't so I give up I was going
to make it a little bigger but doesn't
block too much of the map I think so
we're
fine okay I want to say that wasn't
actually that helpful buddy but I
appreciate the
thought I feel like it at best I mean I
guess they don't have my position so
it's fine it was fine it was fine thank
you Victor the thought was
sweet
okay all
right they already shove this [ __ ]
in oh one thing I have to do today is
change my uh F Keys CU I don't have F
keys on this keyboard to
uh
zxcv so basically the bottom string of
keys to uh to jump to different
povs now if I see a free kill I take a
free kill this is almost a free kill um
you know it actually is a free kill just
not one that I'm involved
in okay that's kind of good though
that's kind of good I mean I'm going to
lie that's really good
so maybe we uh go Abyssal mask help our
Victor
out okay waves pushing in
here their Health's a bit High to make a
consideration like abandoning my camps
to get involved I
think could be wrong in that
front I'm going to do my Grump at the
very least but maybe I smite it and I
Rush on down seems like Jinx might have
just warded
an
ally oh wow
inches I think we get involved
here going for
Jinx y's a homie I don't think I Que in
that
I don't think I Que in I think I grab my
Scuttle I grab my blue I get out [ __ ]
it kitlin might be able to pick that
off okay it's going to force it back
that's
nice so I got to be a little the the
thing that I think is going to separate
me from gold or high silver
and my eventual goal of ooh can we get
involved
here
nice I'm just going to back uh I would
get my blue I think it's too slow though
so we'll just back I'm going to get my
items my Sunfire my boots
actually I'm just going to go atome no
boots atome no boots and a pink Ward and
we're going to clear top to
bottom and and then we'll
consider uh so Graves what did he did he
take he might have taken my Raptor how
does he have
34 cuz we would have
28 he might have just taken a
midwave or maybe top wave I assume he
took some [ __ ] I don't know what he took
he has quite High CS
though
okay all
right bot's quite competitive our mid is
uh healthily up I would say at the
moment our Top's doing good even though
he got ganked quite early I think he's
doing a good job so it's a quite it's
good it's a competent team we love that
none of the lanes are doing that bad
everyone's playing pretty well Victor's
got a level advant
Vantage he bullying luxs off the lane we
love to see that I want to show you
everything I don't even know if that's
her voice line that's just my impression
of Nick doing
Lux okay we're going to grab our gromp
here is there a way we can get involved
the Jinx is quite
low uh but they're they're a bit pushed
in so I don't know how we would get
involved we could dive maybe but I'd
have to go on this
wave cuz the current wave is going to
get blown up so we could
consider okay let's uh let's at the very
least go around the wave's here now
push that [ __ ] in push that [ __ ] in
young
ones you got to get the
wave okay I mean it's close but I don't
have my Al but I do get it here
[Music]
okay probably go dragon off
that we can uh stall this wave
here just to help get more plates
off
and we would love a
dragon I'm going to pull this puppy
out
yep so we're just going to get the
dragon in back if we don't see
Graves could take all of our top
camps uh if he was good he
would you should never assume someone's
bad but we have a lot of gold tool
back all right that was great and we are
[ __ ] Mega powerful now we have
LeAndre we have our first full item I
think Graves probably took our camps if
I had a guess hinger could win this o
nice good
[ __ ] uh I'm going to assume he took my
camps here I should maybe even have gone
bought
directly but I'm just going to take a
peak
yep he
did okay
that's
fine lowkey
expected we're just going to go directly
to
bot I'm not even going to worry about my
camps cuz we are strong as [ __ ] and I
have an
Al okay I should go
around might not even need me
an
[Music]
enemy yeah
tough oh they got the kill without me
it's
nice wait I didn't buy
leandre's that's why I so silver bro
what the [ __ ] I didn't buy
it I was like why am I so weak
okay see making these types of mistakes
still three onone love to see
it I'm think I'm fine I just uh do my
camps and Pad them upwards top wordss
uhoh oh that's not what I was hoping to
see okay I just have to back I can't
well actually I should catch this wave
uhoh well that was a [ __ ]
mistake man that was a really big [ __ ]
I won't lie like the most imaginably
large
[ __ ] I could have made and it might
cost me the game but I'll never make it
again yeah so we went from our huge lead
to basically giving it all back the
graves who didn't even have an item on
me should now have a gold advantage on
me that's tough I ain't going to lie
folks that's [ __ ]
tough it is what it
is all
right I'd like to have a fight
grubs I'm a Dinger stay safe boy
I feel like I can go
here is he saying he has an R
dude why would you
show okay it's
fine uh that's fine Victor got a
kill thank you Sona that was very nice
for you to back
up do they have a jinx
that was them right the [ __ ] was
that dude uh yeah that was tough that
was tough uh I think
we're going to go steel caps and Thorn
mail or maybe I go Merk
Treads hold
up maybe I go Merc
Treads here's what I'm
thinking I go mer
Treads into
Bramble
into uh randuins an
ally oh that's fine we could just go
right
here uh they should win this
oh that was scary mostly just threaten
them with my aura and
flashed okay that's a tough que to miss
I do have
all dude who they should get that kill
for sure right yeah nice they should
kill the Lu
too
nice nice okay so I'm thinking I'm
thinking Bramble for anti some and then
I
go
randuins cuz who's their big threat it's
Graves
does randuins actually help Jinx to
right doesn't Jinx to
crit maybe not
actually I know what's her [ __ ] does
Tristana if it sounds like I don't know
what I'm talking about you're not too
far off dude [ __ ] himad Dinger
soloing that [ __ ] that's badass
okay we don't have ult up so I'm not
trying to
fight uh who's stronger on our team
actually no maybe I should go
they have four here I don't think we win
this I don't have my
ALT that
sucks they all my [ __ ]
that
sucks
okay oh this is not a good idea
you're a little bit
late and he's going to die for it that's
a
bummer that's a bummer happens hinger
happens oh the Victor TP this is crazy
no no objectives no all uh can I stop
this LX from grabbing the
tower can I solo kill theux why the [ __ ]
not
[ __ ] walk her down it's all we got to do
just walk her down we're going to grab
this wave
and we're
out we might not actually be
out yeah that's tough okay we grab
this maybe I just need
Sunfire maybe it is just [ __ ] keep it
simple stupid go Sunfire Sunfire is
good Sunfire is [ __ ]
good Sunfire then Abyssal Maybe
maybe straight to
Abyssal we just have so much
AP I'm just getting I'm getting cooked
by physical though okay let's rock the
Abyssal an
ally hinger sit on his way he wasn't
lying I shouldn't realize what that
would entail okay we got ourselves a
[ __ ]
game we have two dragons we're stacking
drags we love to see it
I don't I can't stop
this he's just going to get the tower
and that's okay
but if I
go I'd rather be stacking drags you get
me you get
me nice rocket
LOL uh-oh
you can pull this Bubby
out JX doesn't have a rocket she can't
really threaten
you 1,00 wait for
it and we outest
I don't know if the flash was necessary
but I thought it was a bit
swag I'm going to stay up I'm going to
wait for my teammates to back
I don't think you're going to get that
hidinger it's okay okay my whole team's
backing so I
back Sunfire oh let me get one pink
Ward okay yeah I think we fight Baron
here
five gold that's
easy o I'm lucky I didn't hit
nice
okay they want to fight mid that's
fine can we back off now
that's
fine I should have communicated better
that I was trying to [ __ ] bait cuz I
don't think we were going to be able to
actually pull the baron but that was
fine we should be able to get this Tower
and this
Tower I don't think the comms are great
on
mine but I think the plays were I think
we go Abyssal Mas 100% it's going to
help Victor and Victor's pretty massive
right now there's a mid gap for sure uh
can they get this certainly
right cuz they really should only be
worried about Graves I might be able to
kill this
boy kill that boy I love
that they're probably got to
go you got to get out of here
hmer oh [ __ ] it's one of the
these it's one of these we stayed too
long and we're getting [ __ ] hella
punished for it and now Victor's going
to go in on it this could be a
mistake that
sucks this [ __ ] blows I don't know
what that [ __ ] [ __ ] that blew my back
out was but that [ __ ] me up really bad
Victor is actually saving it though
thank you Victor for the double kill
thank you Caitlyn what are you doing
yeah I think you're right on the dragon
call I think you're right I'll give you
that Caitlin I think you're
right maybe I get Randy wins after
because it's cheap it's not even that
cheap
yeah I think it's tough I think I played
the fight wrong I think it's fine to go
I think with the Victor TPS in I have to
go but maybe even me walking there made
the Victor TP in I think a [ __ ] like
that it's like what little thing did I
do that help because if no one's there
the Victor isn't TP in right like he's
not
stupid but something I did oh
no I got to protect my
Victor okay we might be able to just end
here
I don't know if we
can oh you're in
trouble so they got to deal with all
that [ __ ] that's fine
oh I think we still go here I think we
still get our Baron
nice uh we can probably just [ __ ] end
it's
fine this safer my girlfriend's calling
me hello girlfriend what's up
what's up girlfriend I'm
recording you need
help okay I can call you
after all right
B okay allow us to end the
game okay Victor backs means I back and
I should back cuz I have a lot of gold I
didn't
realize I thought it was like end of
game I have [ __ ] so many
items but uh it's not it's only been 27
minutes heer's putting up work we should
be able to just go mid and end on this
wave right we have big juicy wave I have
all I'm quite
strong oh she asked if I wanted food no
thank
you but I love you I love you I love you
baby
girl oh that's a big one oh that's a big
one that's one of them big
ones y'all see the [ __ ] that I do now eh
y'all see the [ __ ] that I do eh that's a
Penta
gg gg you guys see the [ __ ] that I do
though huh you know not everything goes
my way but uh make [ __ ] happen make [ __ ]
happen out
there that no no one in my here that's
my mouse that's my keyboard right that's
me doing that [ __ ] so I had silver one
bro all right I'm not like playing at a
[ __ ] Diamond
level pretty close
pretty close you know plat three plat
two sure not Diamond though not Diamond
all right up doot we give one
to hidinger didn't really gank him much
think one time did great Victor 100%
even though you're new character model
looks kind of weird give it to you I
give it to you malash A+ more
importantly 14 LP away from gold that is
right I'll say it again 14 LP away from
gold okay that is fun most damage done
Victor 38,000 we did 19,000 damage we
took
32,000 [ __ ]
45 CC score I don't know how that's
determined but that's pretty good Deluxe
had a nice I saw like a triple she had
she had some good CC but she basically
had the kill power of a
support uh yeah man that's a good one
that's a good one can't can't be too
happy that was some midgap that was some
very clear midgap I think we helped our
mid early on uh which worked out and uh
and we made sure to help our bot I I
didn't even realize she went 18 one in
10 I should have given her the up votes
but uh but happy overall happy overall
with that game Happy overall with that
game and we're GNA boot up another one
we're going to boot up another one
because I'm on a three- win streak and
if I win one more I am gold so let's see
if I can make it
happen let's see you see the difference
though bro online versus offline I'm not
saying my ideas are all there I'm not
saying everything I do is correct but I
am Le there's less noise it's just less
noise it's it's dead ass like parking in
a parking lot with your speakers blaring
it's blaring Katy Perry's Firework and
I'm trying to do a a reverse Park
job I lost my Landing phase in that game
too I was I I was gapped by that Graves
I was gapped by him doesn't matter
doesn't matter stuck to my
fundamentals made sure to uh to uh
engage in the fights that I thought I
could add a lot of value to you know
stick stick to the fundies stick to the
fundies so I look I don't know if pl's
possible uh gold is 1 billion per
possible I wouldn't even say it's
possible I would say it's
like it should happen if I don't hit it
I have I have messed up somewhere
right uh gold that is pl's going to be
tougher plats going to require basically
a win streak which is going to be a bit
of a stroke of luck just because of the
time
frame you
know uh if I had another
month probably could do it pretty
reliably but but the time
is ticking I think we have two weeks
left left in the season June June 7th
January 7th
sorry January 8th so we got eight days
maybe 15 days maybe this is 15 including
today so I I don't exactly know a couple
weeks
basically I did the math I basically
need to win two games a day
but I think that's it I think it's like
I kind of have to win two games a day if
I do that I'm
good oh I like Ezreal bot
Ezreal
okay Alistar and Darius
okay give me my Mumu give me my Mumu
Alistar that's going to be Alistar
support
right I'm actually not super familiar
with
Alistar so I'm need to do a little do
diligence
here I'm going need to do a little due
diligence on how this boy works
[Music]
smashes the ground so he do a knock up
he Rams into an enemy knocking them back
and dealing
magic after begins trampling the ground
becomes ghosted and dealing magic damage
over five seconds nearby enemies his
next five at five seconds next attack
against Champion stunts so he's just a
cc
god what the [ __ ] what's his R
immediately cleanses all disabling
effects and takes
wow
[Music]
Jesus
dude he's a
sicko w w wow okay we're going to have
to go Merk
Treads although it's kind of a AP heavy
team right am I crazy
crazy uh okay we have Ezreal
Lux uh okay let's check out our jungle
cheat sheet O A LeBlanc flip let's check
out our jungle cheat
sheet we are going against Vigo who's
pretty pretty popular he has a
slow
uh he ganks a lot yeah that's the guy
who does the guy who stands Place
sometimes he makes the ground all sticky
like a movie theater flooor and then
walks quicker on it somehow like he's
the [ __ ]
Surfer LeBlanc leblanc's tough this is a
tough this is a tough game I w't
lie this is going to be tough for
me cuz LeBlanc I won't lie I struggle to
hit them qes sometimes I won't lie to
you I won't lie to you dude I need to
uninstall this back seat Dev thing I I
hate it I hate it I'm sorry I hate it I
think it's horrible okay okay so
actually I I am wrong vigo's ad and vain
is AD in my mind they were AP why cuz
they do magical [ __ ] I don't know it's
actually a very ad heavy comp we'll see
what we
build we'll see what we
build I feel like they do life steal
though I'm going to need Bramble
right like Darius does life
steal I feel like in my bones vein do
life Ste I don't even know if that's
right Lux is asking for support who am I
to
not who am I to not
oblige who am I dead ass who am I I
think we should path towards top is that
sick I could quue here now the flash is
enough The Flash is enough we got flash
on who was that that was vain
then I should path bot I should just no
brander path bot at this
point
because she can't flash
out so I'll just start here go towards
bot just go check my
bushes yeah I think I path bot cuz Vin
doesn't have Flash I'm a little wor
worried about atrox
top I do think an atrox can kind of one
v9 the game
but yeah a lot of people are alive man
that's kind of how it
goes all right we turn off the music cuz
we're locked
in all right we Smite that guy to get to
our camp
quicker so Vio presumably started on his
top camps and his pathing
down my ward disappeared
makes sense for him to start on his um
top camps cuz we
showed a lot in his
bot okay Le Blanc just
warded probably this little Bush down
here so Blanc seems quite
competent uhoh trouble in Paradise town
the atrox is kind of [ __ ] on a little
bit
but I think it's just nature of going
against a Darius who has ignite First
Blood that's why we love no
flash and alair is also dead that's
great it's
fine okay
uh wow getting Scuttle tough
now yeah I just I'm not going to [ __ ]
contest
this I got no team to follow
up uh it's not the
dream but I think it is better
than trying to win that Scuttle fight
with no bot
Lane we'll just Sprint up for this top
Scuttle and who knows maybe we can find
some [ __ ] on this
Darius he might have just hoarded I
assume he
did all right
this way buddy come on
March I don't really think I can help
here so I'm not even going to try he's
like full health full health and he
gains Health they're they're having a
war I don't I think I would [ __ ] up more
than I would help you're probably Dead
Zed maybe not
I just I would worry about the vgo at
any
moment he doesn't have TP so we should
probably grab this midwave
nice wait what the
[ __ ] okay
that
sucks
en that
blows yeah [ __ ] did he ping it Zed
signaled that enemies are missing yeah
yeah that was my bad
then that's my bad I was too locked in I
was too locked in I should have just
taken my a star and left they're going
to get drag off this which is fine what
are we going to do in response we're
going to [ __ ] beine over to the uh
boy
grubs you want assistance you really
want to [ __ ] on
this I I don't I'm not six I think it's
a horrible
idea if you can convince Zed to come
over I'll do it but F I'll go I'm down
I'm down a
freak 600
dude what yeah I don't know how to deal
with this
dude I don't know how to deal with this
dude I never
will queuing LeBlanc is just it's like
my nightmare it it's almost just I'm
embarrassed to attempt the
ACT yeah she she's good she's [ __ ]
great she he's [ __ ]
phenomenal okay we got a little bit
greedy there bot did we
not that's
tough okay allar got the double kill did
V
vain is actually terrible well just keep
pushing that [ __ ] Advantage
folks I'm going to give up grubbies
here get my haunting
guys okay
and I'll path
top I'm assuming they're on this [ __ ]
the blanc's got a dark
seal yep she is
there matrox you lowkey [ __ ] up we did
Ping and that's tough that's really
tough I'm not going to lie we did Ping
you we did warn you
[Laughter]
an
ally what Happ to the VIN be ass
Z this can't work out this is a crazy
play
okay what do we got here nice dieo
[ __ ]
[ __ ] dude [ __ ] [ __ ] I need Merk tread
so bad holy [ __ ] I need Merk tread so
bad I should not have Ed her okay that
was brain dead that was [ __ ] brain
dead I had no followup and she is strong
yes never mind great call OWI you
[ __ ] did it again boy you [ __ ] did
it again how do you have the wherewithal
to know that that shutdown's coming
where does that come from somewhere deep
I assume somewhere [ __ ] deep okay
good [ __ ] are is getting
big um we are 81
seconds off of Al
Dron what
loyalty okay
that was
bad not my pris
q i cannect to the [ __ ] Bush they
know I'm [ __ ] [ __ ]
here couple seconds late
there dude [ __ ]
me okay we entered a 4 V3 we get one
what else surely two we get
two uh two for three that's not
phenomenal and we got a triple kill that
all went
onto who got
it Veo I guess yeah vgo
okay I need Merk Treads badly I need
them
yesterday yeah we did get [ __ ] fored
there
I mean I'm down I'm 100% down to go drag
here dude that is a horrible position to
be in asrael I won't even lie you the
Flash
an
Al this is kind of tough without
[Music]
Zed and you're [ __ ] low
HP dude Ezreal are you dumb
now we're out we're
out yeah I should have trust my
that Zed clean up
crew uh [ __ ] that's insane they're so
low
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we
can't do anything without Zed in the
future feels like we're always one
person short yeah so don't start so
don't so let's
wait this is this is
insane this is INS insane
no Lux when you start hitting that [ __ ]
it's going to be insane I swear to God
it's actually going to change a [ __ ]
game uh [ __ ] this is
horrible I can't even Q in this
blows they pulled it far
enough n we got to back off okay I got
to get to farming I got to get to
farming while farming is still
good an ally has been
SL who just
died uh just play your own
game I think the Z's playing really well
to be honest I think you guys are just
probably a little too horny to get [ __ ]
started I I wouldn't blame the Zed for
anything that's happened I think we're
trying to force things when we don't
have advantage and I think you probably
overestimate your skills cuz you called
the Zin bad and she double killed you
guys
solo so you know at a certain point you
can't blame Zed and I'm there every time
so it ain't
me
okay it's a winable game but it's quite
tough now
to
like this Edge
play is real you should get out of that
thing that's actually embarrassing as
[ __ ] that's so annoying there we go I'll
take it
I'll take my shut down that's worth my
life uh but
uh I the atrox he just died solo top
yeah I don't think we need to surrender
guys but I don't think it's looking good
per
se they will get so much gold off this
cuz they're going to get tier 2 top tier
one
bot
um hm
[Music]
H okay a lot of shutdown bonuses to be
had okay my bot Lane is becoming a bit
of a liability
not like stoked about that
fact the I think the Lux is just a bit
tilted at the current state of the
game look I hear
you but the best thing to change a state
is play
better not die
more and at a certain point
you got to take a bit of accountability
nine deaths is a lot of
deaths I missed
it en I'm out folks
an ally
has n we can't just let to get that [ __ ]
free sorry Leon
your team has destroyed a
tret that's close
we don't really have Zed who's a lot of
our damage here folks
okay I went for a steal I think we
should have just not fought the longer
we stall the more that Zed gets top
which is really
valuable please click
no
uh he might die now cuz they're going to
back
uh yeah we should have stall longer that
was my
fault oh you're getting outplayed yeah a
little
bit little bit that's tough okay um what
do I even go here Thorn
Mill yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that was
my bad I thought I could go for a nasty
steel but there's no [ __ ] value in
that I mean there's a dragon but like
whatever it's not Soul gives a [ __ ] I
die my Ezreal
killed and gets a z killed cuz I can
back quicker as opposed to just [ __ ]
poking at him
why do I think I had that [ __ ]
open that was so ugly that was so ugly
why I I just did my wolves that was dumb
as
[ __ ] okay dude that we're playing so
stupid and by we I mean me I'm playing
stupid okay we're fine
they they the the Lux is just the Lux is
engaging a lot I just have to let them
die in [ __ ] insta tilt cuz I only
went in on that cuz I saw them in a
fight and to be fair saw the LeBlanc low
so I was like yeah I'll get
involved but it's like no just let that
[ __ ] dumbass die yeah they got it
but I do have a I do have a [ __ ]
insane
tilter which they're never fun to play
with but you
know okay who's strong it's Zed right
the
[ __ ] I don't know if I could have beat
her in a 1 V one maybe I could have I
just have no idea how she functions
genuinely confuses
me
okay I think I might need to get a
Abyssal mask
right [ __ ] it we'll go Abyssal then we
go Jack
show I'll take the gold folks did what I
could in that fight really did really
did
okay I relation to my parents my dad
died but my mom and I are pretty tight
actually
okay this is
tough this is tough
atrox okay all right the team might have
given up here team might have given
up team might have given
up look I understand the
frustrations I think there's some things
I could have done better
I feel like trying to conflate skill in
a game with love of your parents is
a okay here's our Dream the atrox goes
AFK and we get a AFK loss
bonus makes sense
now he's upset I get
it I don't know why my dead father is
relevant but this is the league player
base think he was just mad at the kill
seal cuz he hasn't said [ __ ] all game
okay how do we turn it around I think it
requires a team
fight that we all win that we target
correctly preferably under Tower as well
we got [ __ ]
baited
okay it's kind of the
start so now we have to clear out the
[ __ ]
bot got paed by a lablanc clone that's
tough it's embarrassing it's not
something I'm proud of did happen
though probably the only time I can
farm and all my camps are
down
1,400 okay it's embarrassing
not much I can do about that
[ __ ] uh do me and Lux win
this tough to say
really that's a pretty crazy TP
yeah there's three
there
okay he's not having a good
time there's four here now couple people
kill themselves it's all right can we
stop them from taking
this I think the answer is a pretty
tight maybe
here yeah I'm not going to get both
those
oh
wow that was clearing the bot wave
that's tough that's
tough
okay that was was a tough one I won't
lie I think our mid lane was our biggest
win potential our bot Lane was good
early but they felled
off I might have just needed to babysit
more and then I I just I I I should have
muted CU I was following pings that I
think were just bad we just had so many
Dragon fights where we were undermanned
or weaker and we just kept doing them
cuz the dragon was
there all
right up atrox no [ __ ] everyone kind of
sucked on my team the ezrael didn't say
much he was
chill uh okay all right one step forward
two steps back that's how it be
sometimes that's how it
be uh yeah that was
tough that was tough in terms of gold
I mean I think the biggest
thing because we were looking good at
the
start was just those fights those Dragon
fights those Dragon fights hurt they
damned
hurt all right still two
away I guess I should say back to two
away maybe I cut the VOD here do I keep
it rolling is just a [ __ ] 4our VOD
maybe
maybe maybe I
do maybe I
do I was due I was
do I I feel like we were winning some
team fights though like we won that
fight where they push I guess the Darius
is a bit reckless in that push though so
maybe that's why we
[Music]
won get me back in
ref I think here here's what I'm
realizing and I and I and I forget it
but I know it people respect results
over everything over any of their
principles their morals their thoughts
their beliefs all of them go out the
window in face of
results so like if you picked Yi top and
you w v9 the game and you had 20 kills
you know zero deaths 20 assists nobody
would really give a [ __ ] even though
they might throw a huge fit that it's
jungle gab you're throwing the game
whatever and so I need to do what's best
for me to get those results for my team
as opposed to trying to
assage what they think the best idea is
for
me you know so it's like when they're
pinging dragon and I'm already pathing
top and I'm like all right fine I'll go
Dragon I think I'm already making a bad
concession cuz not only am I kind of
late to the
objective we're going to something that
I already thought through and thought
was bad idea but I'm changing my mind
because someone else wants to do
it I did that a couple
times I did it a couple times that
game all right and then again that
shouldn't have gone for that Dragon
steel because if I didn't go for that
Dragon steel we would have been so fine
cuz Zed would have gotten top they would
have got drag they would have had zero
kills for it it would have been second
dragon they never even got soul
never even came up so it's like you know
and they got the dragon
anyway but we could have mitigated the
loss at the dragon Zed could have got
top it's worth 700 gold that's
worth uh okay we're going to Mumu he's a
pretty tough champ to counter pick who's
the scariest champ against a Mumu it's
probably
like I mean I think it's volley
bear maybe Brier Brier pretty
well I don't like Warwick but they
banned him so that's cool for
me let's see what you got for me by the
way poay got me this my editor it's a
Dodgers hockey jersey Dodgers on the
front Kings on the back kind of Swag j4
okay they're going j4
jungle
j4 he has that instakill Al I guess it's
not really an instakill but kind of is
an instakill Godlike
CC he's actually decently
tanky he's like a a brw a Bruiser what
do you they call him ganks a
lot builds
M yeah he's
tough he's
tough aelan
Soul
okay oh where the [ __ ] is Jace going
what is this okay hold
up I'm confused
now I'm assuming j4 jungle aurelian Soul
mid Morana support Jace I thought he was
just is he ADC he's mid right can you
play Jayce
top is that a
thing j I don't know we'll see oo I like
my team
though Ash okay let's do I think it's
jce top
Morana Ash bot aelian Soul mid j4 top
right jaay top jaay
top I've just never played against it I
thought he was a mid
guy he might be more common top than mid
actually I'm looking at this stats he's
more common top than he is
mid okay let's do our
best let's do our best oh it's a one
trick
Jace wait no back seat AI shut
up uh how do you check champ mastery
[Music]
okay they
have AP on
Morana and aurelion souls we're going to
have to take a peek at those we're 100%
padding
bot for our Caitlyn and uh
velca cuz I feel like pathing towards
nasis is a crazy man's
task
okay Ash Morana that's a lot of
CC so we're definitely going Merk
Treads uh yeah I think we're definitely
going Merk treads in this game
I think it would also behoove us j4
starting top as well to maybe go
Sunfire a
second
actually I guess it depends who pops off
aelian soul and Morgana start going
[Music]
crazy is Diana AP she is right H we'll
wait we'll see we'll adapt we'll react
[Applause]
okay thanks
Diana not too scared of doing that cuz I
see j4
[Music]
[Music]
uh all right we'll just lock
[Music]
in another game another opportunity
[Music]
[Music]
get him little guy
okay they got a decent batt of Health
here okay done some work against aelan
Soul giving a general ping of
awareness There's an opportunity here
[Music]
nice okay we were pretty aware we knew
we followed the j4 basically from his
spawn uh until he was there we ping for
our team we were able to to uh cut him
off and uh I mean obviously my team did
a [ __ ] Stellar job shout out to them
sweeping the
bot but
uh that knowledge
helps okay we back we'll just
go this and the Pink's fine
all right we want to keep pathing for
bot cuz nasis does NASA stuff we don't
really have to worry about him I don't
think we have to gank him he's got more
XP already I don't know how the [ __ ]
that happens to be honest but he
does he used to
farm
[Music]
okay keep cutting off my autos
[Music]
uhoh
[Music]
[Music]
just clearing top to bot very natural
nothing
crazy kind of want to get Party Time
little party time here probably walk
through the bush
they must have some
Vision it's
[Music]
fine that sucks
[Music]
turn around
bro what are you doing there's a j4
behind us I can't stop
him yeah I I know he's alive
is that [ __ ] up is that BM she mad
about
that why I getting [ __ ] P so
much okay okay mute oh Jesus [ __ ]
Christ I want to put a bolt through my
skull listening to all the PS I don't
know what she wanted in the fight
against
j4 all right we're gonna ignore and we
move
on we're going to go for void
grubs we're going to go for void
grubs although
maybe which should be fine we have PR
[Music]
top that sucks I meant to [ __ ] D that
and he got it before me he's the
[Music]
goat dude he got the [ __ ] Smite off
quick
okay this game's still on our grasp but
couple things are
falling out of our
grasp okay, 1300 for leandre's is kind
of what I want to back
next all right top Lane's doing
great our mid Lane's doing
great are bot Lanes doing great
everyone's doing
great I have to personally start doing
great can we get here in time I think
the answer is
yes dude what is that
[Music]
CC Jesus Christ her CC is insane
oh my God all right well we kill the
ash mid Lane's still doing
great mid Lane's still doing great as I
said
[Music]
okay we have
enough for our Oh What A [ __ ] massive
wave Kind of Perfect Right that it
stopped
here
okay we clear top to bot again we have
no all
[Music]
nasis going One V one j4 could be there
any
second doesn't matter he's nasty
[Music]
uh all right the team's playing
phenomenal this is a phenomenal team Gap
here
j4 he has a blue buff and a red buff so
I think he did both his camps
[Music]
we can help out this nasis we have
[Music]
all
nice that's
[Music]
great B getting the kill is also
nice all right group up up
boys did he get one of the grubs I can't
tell you got
one uh I think that's fine right
it's not
ideal I don't know if his life is worth
for grubs I don't think I know enough of
the value of
grubs okay Merk Treads is 1300 and we
really want that really badly who's
stronger their team right
now kind of j4
right Jesus Christ
we're getting
trounced help our
carry eny has been
SL could have maybe flash
QED
wow got wait for next
wave she outplayed
me wow the tur broke for could hit
me uh I guess we just do this [ __ ]
right maybe not
[Music]
all
right I'm going to go for the I don't
even know if the dragon as valuable
actually I feel like the rift tal is
more valuable cuz like this game's going
fast I don't think we're getting to Soul
this Diana is strong as [ __ ] like let's
break some Towers you know let's knock
some heads together
[Music]
oh that flash timeing was so
gross put a bolet through my skull it's

[Music]
silver this is insane this is bad [ __ ]

lar Rod she got her boots so she's
closing in on our third item he's got
[Music]
one all right I'm going to go
here [ __ ]

objectives okay this could be bad that
is their way into this game I should
have gone for Dragon when I said I

Herald I'm getting cooked for this
mistake
all right I go where Diana
goes you're fine you're not you're
dead sorry they use j40
[Music]

the dark wherever you go I go my queen
[Music]

[Music]
it that's why I did it cuz I know my
sweet sweet Diana will get
me music's a little too happy go [ __ ]
lucky for my
ass all
right mid inhib
secured truly a Gap
game oh this is a little crazy a little
cuckoo beans yeah those a little crazy
beans for sure she's given gold to the
wrong people too I wouldn't want j4 to
be stronger part particularly
particularly stronger at
least th000 gold we need a th000 gold
all right let's get a th000 gold back
and then do our Sunfire
uh and when Diana's back up we party
with Diana wherever she goes we
go Kaitlin walking in like this is kind
of crazy I'm not even going to lie that
was kind of [ __ ] bashit
insane di tpd behind
okay I guess that's
fair uh I think I'm going to go for this
Tower she's like solo ending the [ __ ]
game it's actually insane your tret has
destroyed oh we can't [ __ ] do it
we're getting out proxied
turet has been
destroyed your team has destroyed turet
are they ending can we just end the
[ __ ]
game
no if I hit my Q I could
[Music]
have this is such a brain dead game I
hate it I hate it I know I'm in the
backpack right now but it's tilting me
why did I go in why' I go in I have a
[ __ ] disease in my mind Jesus Christ
dragon's up in 30 I'm going to be dead
now this is oh it's so it's hard it's
hard it's so hard it's so
hard they're just doing so so much stuff
that's anical to what I'm trying to
do like she was trying to she was that
try just trying to end she must just be
a Smurf right who's trying to go GG next
like that can be the only
explanation okay dragon's coming up I
would love to take
it the issue is I'm not
up
okay and they're on it and they're doing
it and it's going to be done
NASA scared him off that's my
man okay I think we go Baron here
no she thinks we can
end she might be right to you
I just got to go with her that's the
thing about it I do just have to do
it I think she's probably right this
Tower's almost
dead dude she's such a Smurf it's
crazy it's crazy I'm just in the [ __ ]
backpack wow
wow wow wow wow wow wow wow okay what
did I learn that game sometimes riot
games is a [ __ ] horrible disease
riddled game company that just [ __ ]
over the people playing and this time it
was my teammates or my opponents I
should
say that that's tough man I feel for
them cuz I was in the backpack that game
my Lord I was in the backpack I'm
getting more LP per win though which is
nice uh sorry I wanted to look at that
stuff I skipped over it
bring me to my match
history okay
overview we had a gold lead from minute
four we never lost it sorry minute three
when the minion
spawned yep that sounds about
right um Damage Done Diana did 388,000
okay it's higher than their top three
people
combined income
Diana was the
richest okay that makes
sense that makes sense just out of
curiosity cuz like look it doesn't
matter game's
over okay I got my
dub just out of curiosity what is that
girl's account looking
like anyway we are back to one game away
from gold back to one game away would
love to hit it we'll see
I'm gaining more LP than I'm losing
which is nice I don't know why that
happened I guess a win
streak seventh resilient yeah I don't
think I played particularly well to be
honest uh okay this
Diana son
byaku Maybe
not maybe this is just what a Fed Diana
looks
like she's silver one
she likely hit
gold off that
[Music]
game now she seems like a good player
with just not enough games
in she must be like a fill or some [ __ ]
is she doing with
someone it doesn't matter it doesn't
matter I don't know why I'm focused on
this cuz she played
crazy is this the power of a
gold is this the
power
okay here it is boys one game off one
game off come on give me give me that
game give me that game I I need to play
well I played well in our first game I
played pretty poorly in the second I got
carried in the third so let's let's play
well in the
fourth cuz we basically had our one game
we're guaranteed to win one game we're
guaranteed to lose now let's have a game
that we have an a big say in the outcome
of Let's Take a
Look Voli malahar maai trik Warwick I've
never seen a TK
ban those bands make a lot of sense to
me oo Shen support I didn't know that
was a thing is it Shen support I mean I
guess it makes sense it just a roaming
Shen oh nope I looked it
up and it has a 6% pick rate quite low
sorry let me check silver okay it's more
common than
silver uh amumu lock it in I love the
big guy Jinx I love that already I love
that
[Music]
already Victor Victor mid love Victor
mid love Camille top feeling cool with
my team what what I hate to see on their
[Music]
team n is
[Music]
jungle that [ __ ] don't make me feel good
Braum Jinx Braum bot Zoe
mid I believe why does Zoe look like an
anime
character Zoe moves it I'm not super
familiar with Zoe I won't lie to you I
won't sit here and [ __ ] lie to
you Darius
[Music]
top who wins
that who wins that is that an even
matchup that seems like a [ __ ] War
for the ages oh [ __ ] Wukong is one of
the ones Le sin less scared of much less
scared of Wukong I'm more scared than
Leen just cuz what Wukong can do in a
team with his ult he starts popping
everybody up I'm trying to be in the
middle of the
fry
Cante okay all right let's take a
look is this Zoe that looks like [ __ ]
Leona oh that's Zoe next uh basic attack
after casting a spell deals magic bonus
damage okay after uh Zoe fires a missile
that she can redirect in Flight like
Yumi
oh just like a like a harsher angle I
see okay spell thief Zoe can pick up the
remnants of a Summoner excuse me sir I
was kind of reading that Zoe can pick up
the remnants the the REM the remnants of
enemy Summoner spell in active item cast
and cast them once
herself
what oh so when they do some [ __ ] they
drop it and if she gets three
Summoner spell it's like flashing [ __ ]
right isn't that a Summoner
spell spell
thief no I guess it would that'd be
crazy if it a summ spell cuz it's just a
[Music]
w okay sleepy trouble bubble she causes
the target to become drowsy then fall
asleep while asleep the target's magic
resist is reduced
is that just pointing click or do you
have to like stand in the circle to fall
asleep I see you had to be in that
right blink to a nearby position for one
second then blink back the [ __ ] what is
this
Echo yo bro game start no [ __ ] off we're
not doing
this all right goal rank up goal rank up
lock in twins lock in okay so they have
have ad Darius
lein
Jinx they have
AP on
their uh on their Zoey and Braum so
they're actually quite ad
heavy so I think it's a Sunfire angle
maybe even a bramble vest I also think I
could consider pathing
top cuz if we get a kill on this Darius
who doesn't have
TP then he's [ __ ] and Cante can be a
bit of a terrorist
no I feel like this could be a
Vibe I don't know I've been pathing
bot
but I just have so much love and respect
in my heart for
cassant but I don't know maybe I should
[ __ ] stick to go bot with k and Chen
also
has some kill
potential n [ __ ] it I'll do this I'll do
this and fellas if you're offering I'll
take the
leash that's good you can each CH there
I mean this is
fast I'm assuming lein also got leashed
just based off where they came from and
how late they came to
Lane which would mean I'm pathing up
with
Le okay
okay tough start for Victor great start
for kaisa oh [ __ ] what the
[ __ ] uh yeah Jinx goes Jinx flash they
got all the sums okay so we kind of want
a party bot
now that's a good start but games aren't
about how you
start you in
here I'm assuming Darius just went to
Ward
okay insane from Darius to be honest
pretty
horrible an Al
okay yeah I don't know I think they play
that pretty insanely horribly it's hard
to phrase it any other
way cool cool me
Darius also
flashed bye the
bye
okay
Victor is getting me pryo for the
Scuttle so I'm going to go for the
scuttle
um
sorry I was not trying to do the dragon
folks okay that was I think good I think
we reacted well to the Le in I think if
I hit that uh Q on The Zo we have a good
shot of uh killing her I think it's
fine the Victor also just kind of got
his wave he's a bit behind which is
fine should have gone around that's one
of those things that there's no point in
doing I just fa I and give it my
location
find
[ __ ] that was tough that was really
tough ah it's bad I should have wait for
six okay that's
nice do I even go for
grabbies I think the answer is
yes because we have a TP
double kill
did he just
fall did he just like fall on his
ass yeah they got
Dragon no if I have [ __ ] ult n fight
it's so much better
and then if I just wait a little longer
before like CU I know they're there
kante was willing to come but I was just
a little too close so I lost too much HP
before he could get there and because
the Victor was coming
too so a couple things I wish I did
different to be honest
nice probably should have walked maybe a
little more before queuing
okay lon's kind of choking feel like
he's just a little too objective
focused team's doing well I love my team
right
now but I had a little twinge in my
heart just now it was a thought if I win
this I would get gold bad thought to
have cuz ultimately you know it doesn't
matter cuz maybe I get gold maybe I lose
it right after maybe I don't get gold
maybe I get it right after okay what
matters is playing every situation to
the best of my
ability okay are cantes winning our mid
is losing our bot is
crushing we get a big page up uh what do
we say we're going to grab
here I think it's merrs
right mer Treads and then Bramble
vests do I even need Bramble vests
really AP is what I have to worry
about what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] Cante
what are
you holy [ __ ]
yeah that's great that's about as much
as you can ask
for I should probably be invading right
now actually he's at 63 he might have
grab some
[ __ ] oh I keep forgetting to get sweeper
it's a bad
mistake uh all right I'm going to go
here cuz this wave is going to be pushed
in cuz kaisa can't slow them
down they ain't here
hopefully we kill them and get two
towers
nice yeah that's exactly what we
want and they'll get void
grubs which is fine just kidding Cante
somehow stole void grubs which is
crazy and he's not dead what the [ __ ] is
this guy
doing how is he still fighting he took
two void
grubs and he killed
them he took all three
how how genuinely how
okay

Cante

out
I think we just have to get with this
Tower

she does magic damage so I almost feel
like I should just go okay who's strong
on my team

worry about so I don't even go I just go
like what's a [ __ ] tanky ass this

fine damn if I got that second hit off I
think we kill the tower yeah we do for
sure [ __ ] hate the tree STP bro uh

fine maybe not I don't know I see Cante
I feel like it's fine but we'll
see he's gotten kind of cook though low

Shen was phenomenal our Cante was
phenomenal our Victor held up you know
that's all he really want our kais said
it great it was a good team the only
lane that lost was uh [ __ ] mid you'd
love to see it damage taken
CC look at the Shen
CC look at that okay all right is plat
possible
already there brother
I don't know I don't know but I hope
this is
SES the coaching allegations yes I'm
getting coached yes I want to get as
good as I can possibly be yes I'd love
some Challenger eyes to be on my
games but I'm winning games with and
without a coach I won six two days ago
by myself I won one two three four five
games today by
myself I won six games yesterday with my
coach I lost two with my coach it's like
what are we doing
here what are we doing here okay you
don't have to [ __ ] take away [ __ ]
from I'm showing you what I'm doing I'm
showing you what I'm bringing to the
table I think if I were to plac myself I
would throw myself
fourth I'd be behind I think they get
Shen first I think it' give Cante second
they might actually give me third behind
maybe they give Zoe third me fourth I
don't think they give kaisa third it's
my op.

good though let me tweet out let me

plat is
possible by the end of the season
but what I do
know is
that what do I
know oh second maybe I played better
than I thought [ __ ] yeah the Shen was
best n no Cante should have been ahead
of me I swear to God op. G has one
algorithm and it is KP and I had the
second as
KP I would have given myself fourth I
would have said Zoe was above me Cante
was above me but I'll take it I'll take
it we played well we did play well we
definitely crushed I mean we won our
[ __ ] Top Lane the game a bit by that
Darius in and playing well around it
